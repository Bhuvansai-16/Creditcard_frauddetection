# ðŸ§  Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a **Random Forest classifier**. 
It includes techniques for handling **imbalanced datasets** using **SMOTE**, training and evaluating a model, and testing it on generated synthetic data.

Here there are two files : 1)Using Logistic regression
                           2)Using Neural networks using relu and sigmoid as activation functions and adam optimizer
